# Project Overview 

This project focuses on performing an in-depth exploration of Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows using SQL. By working with a Kaggle-sourced dataset, the analysis aims to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and insights about Netflix’s global content library. The project demonstrates how SQL can be used to answer real-world business questions such as identifying content distribution across genres, release years, countries, ratings, and more.

# Objective 

-Examine the breakdown of content types by comparing the number of movies to TV shows within the dataset, providing a clearer view of Netflix’s overall catalog composition.
-Determine the most frequently assigned ratings for both movies and TV shows to understand how Netflix’s content is typically classified for different audiences.
-Investigate patterns across release years, countries of production, and content duration, highlighting historical trends, regional representation, and variations in episode or movie length.
-Identify and group titles based on targeted filters, criteria, and keyword searches, enabling deeper insight into themes, genres, or specific content categories.
